		<h1>Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement: Tips</h1>
		<h2>Recognize pronoun agreement when you see it.</h2>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Whenever you use a <a href="personalpronoun.htm">personal pronoun</a> 
		like <span class="special_01">she</span>, <span class="special_01">it</span>, 
		or <span class="special_01">they</span>, you first have to have an
		<a href="antecedent.htm">antecedent</a>, the word that the pronoun is replacing.</p>
		<p>Read this sentence:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Gustavo</span> slowed to 
			the speed limit when <span class="special_01">he</span> saw the police 
			cruiser in the rearview mirror.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The pronoun <span class="special_01">he</span> replaces
		<span class="special_01">Gustavo</span>. Pronouns like
		<span class="special_01">he</span> will keep you from repeating
		<span class="special_01">Gustavo</span>, <span class="special_01">Gustavo</span>,
		<span class="special_01">Gustavo</span> over and over again.</p>
		<p>The pronoun must <em>agree</em> with its antecedent. To navigate this 
		agreement successfully, you will need to know these singular and plural 
		pronoun forms:</p>
		<table class="border">
			<tr>
				<td class="top">Singular</td>
				<td class="top">Plural</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>he, she, they, it<br>him, her, them, it<br>his, her, hers, their, theirs, its<br>himself, 
				herself, themself, itself</td>
				<td>they<br>them<br>their, theirs<br>themselves </td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The general rule for pronoun agreement is straightforward: A singular 
		antecedent requires a singular pronoun; a plural antecedent needs a plural 
		pronoun.</p>
		<p>Read these examples:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">The <span class="special_01">boy</span> scratched
			<span class="special_01">his</span> armpit.</p>
			<p class="example">The <span class="special_01">boys</span> scratched
			<span class="special_01">their</span> armpits.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In most cases, you won&#39;t need to debate whether you need the singular 
		or plural form. The spoken English you have heard will help you make the 
		right pronoun choice when you write.</p>
		<p>English also, unfortunately, includes some <em>special</em> agreement 
		situations. These will require your more careful attention.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Know how <span class="special_u">each</span> and <span class="special_u">
	every</span> can complicate pronoun agreement.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>In math, 1 + 1 = 2. This rule applies to pronoun agreement as well. If 
		you have 1 singular noun + 1 singular noun, then together they = 2 things, 
		or a <em>plural</em> antecedent.</p>
		<p>Read these examples:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">The woodpecker <span class="special_01">and</span> 
			his mate tried <span class="special_01">their</span> best to oust the 
			squirrel who had stolen <span class="special_01">their</span> nest.</p>
			<p class="example">Ronald wanted the attention of the cheerleader
			<span class="special_01">and</span> the baton twirler, but he could 
			not make <span class="special_01">them</span> look his way.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The plural pronouns <span class="special_01">their</span> and
		<span class="special_01">them</span> are logical and ear-pleasing choices 
		for <span class="special_01">woodpecker + mate</span> and
		<span class="special_01">cheerleader + baton twirler</span>, respectively.</p>
		<p>Two words, however, have incredible sentence power.
		<span class="special_01">Each</span> and <span class="special_01">every</span> 
		are singular and can strong-arm an otherwise plural antecedent to become 
		singular as well. In most cases, this will make no difference to the sentence,
		assuming that the antecedents do not match in gender. However, if they do
		match, then the corresponding gendered singular pronoun should be used instead
		of the singular <span class="special_01">they</span>.</p>
		<p>Watch what happens:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">The manager <span class="special_01">and</span> his 
			assistant ate <span class="special_01">their</span> lunch at the break
			room table.</p>
			<p>Now, adding <span class="special_01">each</span>:</p>
			<p>If the managers and their assistants are all male:</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Each</span> manager and assistant 
			ate <span class="special_01">his</span> lunch at the break room table.</p>
			<p>If the managers and their assistants are all female:</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Each</span> manager and assistant 
			ate <span class="special_01">her</span> lunch at the break room table.</p>
			<p>If the gender of each manager and assistant is not specified, not matching,
			or non-binary:</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Each</span> manager and assistant 
			ate <span class="special_01">their</span> lunch at the break room table.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Every</span> manager, assistant, 
			salesperson, and engineer ate <span class="special_01">their</span> 
			lunch at the break room table.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span class="special_01">Each</span> and <span class="special_01">every</span> 
		will also change the verbs that have to agree:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">Whenever a diner walks in five minutes before closing, 
			the cook <span class="special_01">and</span> waitress
			<span class="special_01">sigh</span> and <span class="special_01">roll their</span> 
			eyes.</p>
			<p>Because gender is not specified, singular <span class="special_01">they</span> is
			utilized.</p>
			<p class="example">Whenever a diner walks in five minutes before closing,
			<span class="special_01">every</span> cook and waitress
			<span class="special_01">sighs</span> and <span class="special_01">rolls their</span> 
			eyes.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Understand how correlative conjunctions can confuse pronoun agreement.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Exercise caution when you use <a href="correlativeconjunction.htm">correlative 
		conjunctions</a> like <span class="special_01">either ... or</span>,
		<span class="special_01">neither ... nor</span>, and
		<span class="special_01">not only ... but also</span>. Because correlative 
		conjunctions have two parts, you&#39;ll find two separate antecedents.</p>
		<p>Read these examples:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">Not only the handpicked <span class="special_01">
			flowers</span> but also the <span class="special_01">homemade peanut 
			butter pie</span> will win Briana&#39;s heart with
			<span class="special_01">its</span> thoughtfulness.</p>
			<p class="example">Not only the <span class="special_01">homemade peanut 
			butter pie</span> but also the <span class="special_01">handpicked flowers</span> 
			will win Briana&#39;s heart with <span class="special_01">their</span> 
			thoughtfulness.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Notice that you have <em>two</em> antecedents, the
		<span class="special_01">homemade peanut butter pie</span> and the
		<span class="special_01">handpicked flowers</span>. Use the <em>closer</em> 
		of the two antecedents to determine if you need a singular or plural pronoun.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Recognize the problems that singular indefinite pronouns can cause concerning 
	pronoun agreement.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p><a href="indefinitepronoun.htm">Indefinite pronouns</a>, a special class 
		of words, will often be antecedents. Some indefinite pronouns—despite the 
		illogic—are always singular:</p>
		<table class="border">
			<tr>
				<td class="top">Singular Indefinite Pronouns</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>each, either, neither<br>anybody, anyone, anything<br>everybody, 
				everyone, everything<br>nobody, no one, nothing<br>somebody, someone, 
				something</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Words like 
		<span class="special_01">everyone</span>, <span class="special_01">somebody</span>, 
		and <span class="special_01">nothing</span> are singular and require a singular 
		pronoun for agreement. When the antecedent refers to a person, this pronoun will
		often be the singular <span class="special_01">they</span> because gender is rarely
		specified.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Everyone</span> on the planet 
			deserves clean water to quench <span class="special_01">their</span> thirst.</p>
			<p class="example">Can you believe it? <span class="special_01">Somebody</span> 
			left <span class="special_01">their</span> dog in a hot car with the windows
			rolled up!</p>
			<p>In this instance, the antecedent refers to a thing, not a person, so the
			singular pronoun <span class="special_01">it</span> is utilized.
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Nothing</span> is in
			<span class="special_01">its</span> place after the violent shaking from
			the earthquake.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Because this group of indefinite pronouns is singular, it is important to
		remember the distinction between singlar and plural forms of 
		<span class="special_01">they</span>. The singular pronoun 
		<span class="special_01">they</span> and its other forms includes all people,
		regardless of their gender identity. It is often mistaken for the plural pronoun 
		<span class="special_01">they</span>, but these two are different in that 
		the singular <span class="special_01">they</span> applies to only one person,
		while the plural form applies to multiple people or multiple things. It is
		appropriate to verify a person's preferred pronouns before you refer to them
		with any particular set of pronouns.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Realize that not all indefinite pronouns are strictly singular.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Another group of indefinite pronouns are singular <em>or</em> plural, 
		depending on the information from the <a href="prepositionalphrase.htm">
		prepositional phrase</a> that follows.</p>
		<table class="border">
			<tr>
				<td class="top">Indefinite Pronouns That Can Be Singular or Plural</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>all, any, none, more, most, some</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Read these examples:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Some</span> of this footwear 
			smells because Tina wears <span class="special_01">it</span> to the 
			barn.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Some</span> of these shoes 
			smell because Tina wears <span class="special_01">them</span> to the 
			barn.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In the first sentence, <span class="special_01">footwear</span> makes
		<span class="special_01">some</span> singular, so
		<span class="special_01">it</span> is the pronoun that agrees. In the second 
		sentence, <span class="special_01">shoes</span>, a plural
		<a href="noun.htm">noun</a>, has all the power. <span class="special_01">
		Some</span> becomes plural too, and <span class="special_01">them</span> 
		is the appropriate pronoun for agreement.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Know how to handle pronoun agreement with collective nouns.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p><a href="collectivenoun.htm">Collective nouns</a> name groups [things] 
		composed of members [usually people].</p>
		<p>Here are examples:</p>
		<table class="border">
			<tr>
				<td class="top">Collective Nouns</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>army, audience, board, cabinet, class<br>committee, company, 
				corporation, council<br>department, faculty, family, firm, group<br>
				jury, majority, minority, navy<br>public, school, senate, team, 
				troupe</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>When the members of the group act <em>in unison</em>—everyone doing essentially 
		the same thing at the same time—then the collective noun is singular and 
		requires singular pronouns for agreement. </p>
		<p>Read these examples:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">The <span class="special_01">family</span> is at 
			the table, ready for <span class="special_01">its</span> dinner, when 
			Grandma prepares her delicious chicken pot pie.</p>
			<p class="example">The <span class="special_01">committee</span> decided 
			to spend <span class="special_01">its</span> budget surplus on yo-yos 
			for the officers.</p>
			<p class="example">The <span class="special_01">team</span> agreed to 
			host a car wash to finance <span class="special_01">its</span> farthest 
			away game.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>When, however, the members of the group act <em>as individuals</em>—each 
		person taking on separate responsibilities or actions—then the collective 
		noun is plural and requires plural pronouns for agreement. </p>
		<p>Look what happens:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">When Grandpa begins boiling liver, the
			<span class="special_01">family</span> quickly find other plans for
			<span class="special_01">their</span> dinner.</p>
			<p class="example">At the car wash, the <span class="special_01">team</span> 
			took <span class="special_01">their</span> places so that each vehicle 
			got vacuumed, washed, and dried.</p>
			<p class="example">The <span class="special_01">committee</span> disagree 
			if <span class="special_01">they</span> should offer Billie financial 
			assistance after he suffered a concussion during an unfortunate yo-yo 
			accident.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>If deciding whether the collective noun is singular or plural makes your 
		head hurt, remember that you have a couple of options.</p>
		<p>First, you can substitute a regular plural noun for the collective noun. 
		Then you can use a natural-sounding plural pronoun.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">The <span class="strike">team</span>
			<span class="special_01">football players</span> [or
			<span class="special_01">athletes</span>, or
			<span class="special_01">teammates</span>] earned 500 dollars for
			<span class="special_01">their</span> trip.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Another option is to add the word <span class="special_01">members</span> 
		after a collective noun. <span class="special_01">Members</span> is a plural 
		antecedent and requires an ear-pleasing plural pronoun.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">When Grandpa has dinner duty, the family
			<span class="special_01">members</span> stretch
			<span class="special_01">their</span> budgets eating dollar items from 
			the value menu at Tito&#39;s Taco Palace.</p>
			<p class="example">The committee <span class="special_01">members</span> 
			wish that <span class="special_01">they</span> had spent their surplus 
			on soft teddy bears, not skull-crushing yo-yos.</p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Unlike collective nouns, named businesses, schools, and organizations are 
	always singular.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Many people comprise a business, school, or organization. For the purposes 
		of pronoun agreement, however, consider these three groups singular and 
		use <span class="special_01">it</span>, <span class="special_01">its</span>, 
		or <span class="special_01">itself</span> to maintain agreement.</p>
		<p>Read these examples:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="example">To increase <span class="special_01">its</span> profits,
			<span class="special_01">Tito&#39;s Taco Palace</span> packs
			<span class="special_01">its</span> burritos with cheap refried beans.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">Weaver High School</span> 
			encourages <span class="special_01">its</span> students to make leaner 
			lunch choices, such as hot, steaming bowls of squid eyeball stew.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="special_01">The Southeastern Association 
			of Salt &amp; Pepper Shaker Enthusiasts</span> will hold
			<span class="special_01">its</span> annual convention in Atlanta.</p>
