<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">This is a recipe
that was passed down to my mum from my grandmother on my father’s
side. It’s a family classic, and while it’s technically called
“autumn loaf cake,” we just refer to it as “pumpkin bread.” I
want to share this recipe with you because of its importance to my
family — every time I visit my cousins’ houses, this is baked at
some point during the visit, and we have it for breakfast. Of course,
I also want to share it because it tastes good. It’s surprisingly
good for breakfasts; just make sure to drink something with it,
especially if it’s milk or some alternative.</P>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">This recipe would not be possible without the Columbian Exchange. Pumpkin, which is native to North America, would not have originally been available to Europeans for any purpose, including as food. The chocolate, too, is something that would have been exclusive to the New World in the time of Columbus. The pumpkin, however, is the main ingredient giving this bake its flavor. When Europeans began to explore the Americas, the pumpkin was one of the crops that — forgive the term — cropped up practically everywhere. It was mentioned many times, and was found to not only be edible, but in fact taste quite pleasant. Exportation of these large squash occurred from much of the North American continent, meaning that explorers from Europe must have met a large variety of native peoples during their exploration. In fact, much of what Europeans learned about how to prepare and eat pumpkins came from native traditions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">In modern times, of course, pumpkins are a bit different than in the 17th century, and they’re much more easily accessible. For example, the pumpkin used for this recipe was bought pre-prepared in a can.</p>
